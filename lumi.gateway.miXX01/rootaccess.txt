Warning: For this you need to open the device. Make sure that you never touch the power supply, as it is connected directly to mains (110V/220V).

Warning2: This works so far only for the versions without homekit. The Aqara Homekit versions have a different firmware, where additional steps are required.

Warning3: Be careful what you do, as there is no fallback or recovery method.

1. Open the device. Be careful with removing the screws, as the plastic inside breaks easily (it is adviced to losen up all screws equaly to avoid that).
2. Connect your serial adapter to GND, TX and RX (see pinout). Do not connect VCC/3.3V.
3. Setup your serial port with 115200 Baud, Flow control off!
4. Power on Gateway, as soon as you see any output, press multiple times "Enter" to exit in the U-Boot shell
5. setenv bootargs 'console=ttymxc0,115200 ubi.mtd=3 root=ubi0:rootfs rootfstype=ubifs cma=96M mtdparts=gpmi-nand:3m(boot),7m(kernel),1m(dtb),-(rootfs) rw single init=/bin/bash'
6. As soon as you see the prompt, paste this command line: "mv /etc/rc5.d/K10dropbear /etc/rc5.d/S99dropbear"
6a) (You have only a few seconds time until the watchdog resets the gateway)
7. redo 2-5
8. Set the root password by using the command "passwd". You have again only a few seconds time until the watchdog kicks in.
